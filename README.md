# movie_list_flutter
Just a basic movie list app I made to learn flutter and its integration with hive database.
The app shows list of favourite movies details (like Movie Name, Director and Movie Poster) stored locally.
The app also features like supports adding new movie details, editing movies details and deleting the app.

Here are a few Screenshots of the app
